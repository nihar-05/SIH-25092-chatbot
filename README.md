## ‚ú® Features  

- Interactive chatbot interface with dynamic, AI-powered responses  
- Backend agent logic in **Python (FastAPI)** with **LangChain + Gemini** for NLP  
- **LangGraph** for orchestrating multi-step conversations  
- **Tavily Web Search** integration to provide real-time information from the internet  
- **PostgreSQL storage** (via SQLAlchemy) for saving queries and responses  
- Modern, responsive UI built using **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**  
- Modular and scalable architecture for future enhancements
